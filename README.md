codeChallenge
=============
Various challenges from codeeval.com

Not all the challenges in the repo are completed challenges (though most are). If the file(s) don't have run time reported
memeory used reported, etc... at the top of the main file filled in, then the challenge has not been completed. 

codeeval.com does not offer D as a language...but I've rewritten some of the challenges in D, as examples for somebody who stumbles onto this repo. I noticed a lacking of 'school-work' level examples while I was trying to pickup D.
